# cellular-automata
sand and water cellular automata with some that language that decides to work for me...

# Rust Version (main ver)
Implementing this version with `Specs` and `GGEZ`.
Not functional atm.

# Python Version
Utilizes `ecs` and `pygame` to provide a simulation of sand and water.
Was working, will restore to older version where sand and water worked.
